### Kate Alice Moore's Portfolio
> Boston, MA

#### Skilled in: 
R/RStudio (the tidyverse), Python (pandas, numPy, matplotlib), SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
<br> Currently learning Scrapy + BeautifulSoup!

Much of my work is proprietary, and finding open-source datasets with enough complexity to reflect my skill level is difficult! I am constantly searching for appropriate dummy datasets to test analyses on. 

### Projects
+ Simple A/B Test Evaluation
+ Local Internet Usage Analysis
