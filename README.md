<br> Much of my work is proprietary, so I am putting together a composition of smaller, self-driven analyses and volunteer work. Finding appropriate open-source datasets is difficult, so I'll be pushing updates as I find new datasets to showcase certain skills. 
I am open to discussing my industry work (pieces of which I have gotten pre-approval to share for the purpose of interviews).
